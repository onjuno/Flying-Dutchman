### Team Name
The Drunken Captain


#### General Project Description

The Flying Dutchman is a local pub in Downsala seeking to modernize its operations while maintaining its traditional charm and fostering a sense of community among its patrons. To address long queues at the bar and enhance the customer experience, the pub aims to implement a new ordering system and touch-screen beer selection stations throughout the venue. Additionally, the idea of offering VIP customers a credit system and access to a VIP cooler for self-service has been proposed.

The project entails developing a comprehensive system to assist bartenders, enable table-side beer selection with orders processed at the bar, and facilitate VIP customer orders and payments.

### Use of any chatbots

- Jannik Recklies: I mainly used ChatGPT in order to create some basic structures like tables, forms, etc. that I could then use and refine so it fits to the overall project. I also used it for debugging purposes.
- Apostolos Nektarios Pittis: I used chatgpt to try and implement the undi redo on customer page
- Meilin : I didnâ€™t really use ChatGPT
- Others: ???

#### Dependencies

- jquery-3.3.1

#### Getting Started
