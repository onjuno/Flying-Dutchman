### Team Name
The Drunken Captain


#### General Project Description

The Flying Dutchman is a local pub in Downsala seeking to modernize its operations while maintaining its traditional charm and fostering a sense of community among its patrons. To address long queues at the bar and enhance the customer experience, the pub aims to implement a new ordering system and touch-screen beer selection stations throughout the venue. Additionally, the idea of offering VIP customers a credit system and access to a VIP cooler for self-service has been proposed.

The project entails developing a comprehensive system to assist bartenders, enable table-side beer selection with orders processed at the bar, and facilitate VIP customer orders and payments.
